# SourceViewer
assembly viewing tool

the goal is to allow viewing dissasmblies from the perspective of the source file without taking over your compilation setup.

# Platforms
its becoming ridiclously hard to get correct dwarf info on windows and mac files.
for the life of me I cant bother. so for now i am building only for linux but the parsing on other platforms is there.
if you manage to get a valid dwarf format on windows or mac the program should support it
